SLURM scripts for MARCC

This repository contains SLURM script templates for the Maryland Advanced Research Computing Center (MARCC). Identifying the correct modules to include (or exclude) for a given type of experiment can be tedious, so I decided to store blank template scripts for experiments here.

In order to use the templates, just replace the SLURM options whose values are in all caps, refine the time estimate based on your job, and give your runtime commands below the includes.

If others have SLURM templates they'd like to add to the repo, feel free to issue a pull request.
